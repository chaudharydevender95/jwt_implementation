﻿###The API
The API will have 4 endpoints and will communicate JSON with at least the following functionality for each end point:

/login - a POST request that will accept no input and return a token (which need to be used in subsequent calls to the API, in the Authorization header). Every call to /login will return a new token and every invocation to this endpoint creates a new user, gives them a preset balance in a preset currency.
/balance - a GET request that will accept an Authorization header (with the token value output from /login) and will return the current balance along with the currency code.
/transactions - a GET request that will accept an Authorization header (with the token value output from /login) and will return a list of transactions done by the user with atleast the date, description, amount, currency for each transaction.
/spend - a POST request that will accept an Authorization header (with the token value output from /login), JSON content representing one spend transaction with the transaction date, description, amount, currency.
